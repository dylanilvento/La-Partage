Hey, uh… I wanted to know
about the guy out behind
the restaurant.

[Switch]
Who is it? Were they bothering
you?


[Switch]
No… He said he used to work here,
and he’d like his job back.


[Switch]
Ho boy. Talked to Dale, did you?
Guy can’t even talk to me himself.


[Add Var]
<Talked to Cooper>
Listen, I see you’re trying to help
the guy, but he had to go.


You can’t just show up to work drunk
and expect to stick around.
