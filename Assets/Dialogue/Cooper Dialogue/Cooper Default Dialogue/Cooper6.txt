Look, this restaurant’s
greatest asset is its employees.


We’ve got a great serving staff.



We’ve got our bartender Aggie,
who does a fantastic job behind
the bar by herself, even when it’s
slammed.
We also have plenty of other fantastic
cooks in the kitchen.


Dale needed to go; I had to think
about the rest of the staff
and our patrons.
