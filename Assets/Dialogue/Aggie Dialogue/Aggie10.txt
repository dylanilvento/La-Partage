Hey, Cooper!



[Cooper]
Yes, ma’am.



[Aggie]
I was talking to your friend here.
I'm sorry, I didn't get your name.


[Jack]
Jack.



[Aggie]
I was just talking to Jack here,
and he was saying that we may have
been a little harsh on Dale.

[Cooper]
Did he now...



[Aggie]
I think so too.



[Cooper]
What?



[Aggie]
Why don't we give him one more
chance?


[Cooper]
I don't think that's a good idea,
Aggie.


[Aggie]
C'mon, one more chance. I'd greatly
appreciate it.

<Convinced Cooper to talk to Dale>
[Cooper]
*Sigh*
Alright then, let’s go talk to him.
