I messed up so badly tonight.



[Switch]
What? What happened?



[Switch]
Regina, the person I came with
tonight, is missing, and I have no
idea what to do or who to turn to.

[Switch]
Can't you call her?



[Switch]
I don't have her number.



There's nothing I can do.



[Switch]
Is there any way that I could help?



[Switch]
I know Dale knows something about what
happened to her, but he's still upset
about losing his job.

Is there any way you could talk to
Cooper about giving him another
chance?

[Switch]
I don't know if I can do that.

JACK:
Please! I've already spoken to him,
and it sounds like he respects you
and listens to what you say.
I just need help finding her.
