What do you do on your off time?



[Switch]
I'm a student of history.



[Switch]
What time period?



[Switch]
Not so much a time period as a
subject. I read a lot about
alchemy.

[Switch]
Alchemy, huh?



[Switch]
Yeah, it's fascinating to learn
about how people believed they
could achieve whatever they wanted
with the right combination.
Transmute lead into gold,
eternal life, love elixirs,
all that.

What about you? Have any interests
beyond what's on your profile?
Or is "reading" and "walking" 
all you do?
