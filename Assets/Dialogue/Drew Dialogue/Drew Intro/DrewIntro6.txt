Flowers?



[Switch]
Don’t tell me you forgot flowers.
You’re breaking all sorts of
dating laws doing that.

How do you expect to bed her
if you don’t enact the proper
rituals?

[Switch]
It’s a first date, Drew.
I don’t plan on there being any
“bedding.”

[Switch]
Hey, don’t be so pessimistic.
That attitude is what ended your
last four dates. 

Listen, girls like confidence.
Without any, you’re not going
to get... any.

Now go buy some confidence flowers.
Trust me.


[Switch]
Alright, whatever.
I’ll talk to you later.


[Switch]
Call me if you need anymore advice.
